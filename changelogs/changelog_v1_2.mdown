## ProjectPlus Version 1.2

  * SCM Badges would not display in some cases
    * When a project was saved in a directory other than the project root, badges would not display.
    * Also fixes some other less common cases which would prevent badges from working.

Please report any issues you find at the [bug tracker](http://ciaranwal.sh/projectplus-files/ticket).
